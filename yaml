# Reflection â€“ MDVP (Humility, Gratitude, Integrity)

**Humility**

- All actions are logged transparently.

**Gratitude**
- Feedback is persisted and surfaced in explain logs.
- `/agent/mdvp` explicitly thanks human guidance.

**Integrity**
- Scoring is explainable and auditable.
- DB + CSV persistence ensures reproducibility.

**Daily Value Push**
- Day 1: CVâ€“JD matching
- Day 2: Values + Sentiment scoring
- Day 3: RL loop with reward updates
- Day 4: Productionized service (APIs + Docker)
